First of all we started building navbar
Added the navbar and started styling it

we add a line .container in CSS in which we set our margin width 
and margin inline auto to cet the items in center according to the width 
the overflow as hidden
And also make a flex class generally

We also changed the cursor to pointer when we hover ay certain elements in navbar


We added some animation as transition to the cards in main div 
Use <template> to hold some content that will be hidden when the page loads. 
Use JavaScript to display it:

we have to use our own api key for this project and we have to make an account on 
newsapi.org
We have to make a async function to fetch qwery
We would have to bind the data for this 

We deep clone card div to clone all the div inside it

To LocaleString IS used to convert to our format
